# cs2-configs
Here is an autoexec.cfg for your client on Counter-Strike 2 and a practice.cfg for you to use when going over grenades etc. on your own server. 
Remember to place the files in a directory that looks something like this:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg
Remember, when you boot up cs2 you need to type exec autoexec to enable the autoexec configuration and exec practice to enable the practice configuration.
Let me know if there needs to be changes made or if there are issues with the configs.
